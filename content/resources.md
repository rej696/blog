# Learning Resources
This is a page full of resources I have used through my career and would recommend to others.

## General
General links/course that might be relevant for anyone interested in computer stuff

#### - [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)
This is the single best online course I have ever done. You learn how computers
work by building them up from the basic building blocks incrementally. Doing
this course was a big Aha! moment for me, where I finally (felt like) I
understood what is going on in a computer that makes it think.

I completed this course and read [Code](https://codehiddenlanguage.com/) at a
similar time, and following along with both was great!

#### - [Missing Semester of your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)
This is mandatory reading. Explains/Introduces essential tools and techniques
that are invaluable for a career software engineer, such as using bash for
shell scripting, efficient text editing using vim and tmux, the basics of
unix/linux tools, Git etc.

A really good jumping off point for developing your skils as a software
engineer.

#### - [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)
This is a great site that suggests a curriculum based on different resources
available online (or in books). I used this alot before and during my CS MSc to
see what other topics I felt like I was missing and to direct me what I should
be learning. I haven't read or completed everything there, but its great to
have somewhere to start to build your own journey. One day I will finish
reading SICP!!

#### - [Learn X in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/)
Very useful site for getting a quick overview of a language. I frequently used
this when playing about with all sorts of languages in the past and find it a
clear reference if I have forgotten some syntax of a language I don't use
frequently.

## Git
#### - [Learn Git Brancing](https://learngitbranching.js.org/):
This is a super tutorial, that really helped me get to grips with what is
happening in git beyond the normal add commit push pull loop. After doing this
tutorial (and a bunch of practice after) I now feel confident I could fix any
horrible situation git can throw at me.

If `git rebase` fills your soul with fear, do this tutorial!!

## Embedded Software
#### - [Modern Embedded Systems Programming Course](https://www.state-machine.com/video-course)
Miro Sameks Master Class! If you are interested in being an embedded software
engineer, this is THE course. I wish someone had sent me this when I was
younger!

Do yourself a favour, get a board and follow along.

#### - [Making Embedded Systems](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/making-embedded-systems/9781098151539/)
A very nice conversational introduction to embedded systems. Not focused on
coding, as much as arming you with the knowledge you need to be a sucessful
embedded software engineer. A great book to read if you are just starting out!

Also, the author hosts a podcast [Embedded.fm](https://embedded.fm/) where they
chat with interesting people in the embedded space. There are loads of great
episodes and I found out about a lot of cool projects and tools from listening

#### - [The Definitive Guide to ARM Cortex M3 and Cortex M4 Processors](https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780124080829/the-definitive-guide-to-arm-cortex-m3-and-cortex-m4-processors)
It is what it sounds like, and its an absoulte life saver. If you work with a
CortexM3/4 microcontroller, you should have this book on your desk. Mine is
full of postit notes, cos who has time to remember the difference between a
BusFault and a MemManage fault...

#### - Other References
The following are a few links/articles that helped me figure out different
technologies, or that I still look back to:
- [Makefile Tutorial](https://makefiletutorial.com/#top)
- [LinkerScript Tutorial](https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/how-to-write-linker-scripts-for-firmware)

## C Programming
There are loads of C programming books, and I have read several. If you want to
get started, then I recommend looking at [Beej's guide to C
programming](https://beej.us/guide/bgc/html/split/)/, as this is available
online and pretty easy going, while still being comprehensive.

#### - [K&R The C Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language)
Classic, and still good today!

#### - [Headfirst C](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-c/9781449335649/)
The first book I read about C programming. In 2020, when I
was starting my career, I saw a job advert for an embedded
software engineer role at ClydeSpace that had the
requirement "proficient C programmer". At that point, I
knew I wanted that job eventually, and so I ordered this
book, having previously read parts of "HeadFirst Design
Patterns" and enjoyed it. I then worked my way through the
book, doing all the exercises, and a few years later I'm
an embedded software engineer at ClydeSpace writing
software for CubeSats.

If you are new to programming, like I was at the time, then I would definitely recommend this book; even if you aren't a big reader (the book is very interactive with lots of exercises).

#### - [Expert C Programming: Deep C Secrets](https://archive.org/details/expert-c-programming-deep-c-secrets-by-peter-van-der-linden)
War stories from the sun compiler team. Some of it is dated, but the book is
very funny. If you want to learn all the horrible/glorious things you can do
with C, this is the book to read.

#### - [C Interfaces and Implementations](https://drh.github.io/cii/)
I started reading this, but yet to finish it, but what I have read so far is
very good. The book is written in a literate style, which I found a bit
strange, and the structure is going through different data structures and
patterns in C code, designing the interfaces for them, and then going through
their implementation. I think finishing this book will be very useful for me at
the moment.

#### - [Effective C](https://nostarch.com/Effective_C)
A good journeyman C book about writing secure, modern C code.

#### - [Modern C](https://gustedt.gitlabpages.inria.fr/modern-c)
Another book about writing modern C code. I started this but didn't finish it
as I had only just finished reading Effective C, and I think the two share a
lot of ground. However, Modern C is freely available online, and a new edition
covers C23, so I would be interested to revisit it.

#### - [cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c)
The best C reference on the internet. If I need to figure out how to use a
standard library function, or what C version/complier implements some modern
feature, this is the place I look.

## Perl
I've been learning perl recently, by reading [Learning Perl (the llama
book)](https://www.learning-perl.com/). Its very easy to read, written in an
funny style, and I'll soon be moving onto the next in the series, [Intermediate
Perl](https://www.intermediateperl.com/), which I expect to be just as good!

## Python
Run `python3` to enter the repl, and run `help()` to get interactive docs.

I never really read any books on python, I learned most of my python through
training and solving problems at work and by getting help from colleagues. The
python docs are great however.

## Terminal Stuff
- Neovim
- Tmux


## Digital Signal Processing

I want to learn DSP to be able to write synthesiser
eventually. I have been using the guide [From zero to
boutique module
manufacture](https://pichenettes.github.io/mutable-instruments-documentation/tech_notes/education/),
which is a document written by the creator of mutable
instruments to outline what you might need to learn to
build synths, and the resources you could use. As such, I
have "Understanding Digital Signal Processing" on my
shelf, ready to go whenever I decide to commit to reading
it!

## Typing
You should learn to touch type, here are some resources:
- https://monkeytype.com/
- https://www.keybr.com/
- https://ranelpadon.github.io/ngram-type/

Also, get a split keyboard for better posture/ergonomics:
- [Helidox Corne](https://mechboards.co.uk/collections/featured/products/helidox-corne-kit)

## Lisp
I want to use lisp, but how?

#### - [Clojure for the brave and true!](https://www.braveclojure.com/)
This is the first programming book I ever read, and clojure is the second
language I learned (after python). I never really coded anything in anger in
clojure, but reading about it taught me about lisp, functional paradigms and
all the myriad ways of doing things in different language. Reading this book
also made me realise that many programming books are actually fun to read!
(unlike previous textbooks I had read at school or uni)

I would definitely recommend learning something different to what you know,
even if you never use it again. Its a great way to widen your perpective.

#### - [The roots of lisp](https://paulgraham.com/rootsoflisp.html)
One of the most enlightening things I have ever read. Very short article explaining the building blocks of a lisp interpreter. Absolutely worth reading!


## Forth

#### - Starting Forth

#### - [JonesForth](https://github.com/nornagon/jonesforth/blob/master/jonesforth.S)

#### - [Ratfactor Blog Post](https://ratfactor.com/forth/the_programming_language_that_writes_itself.html)

#### - [DuskOS](https://duskos.org/)

#### - [lua miniforth](http://angg.twu.net/miniforth-article.html)
I used this article to implement [a forth for neovim](https://github.com/rej696/dotfiles/tree/main/nvim.lazy%2Flua%2Fluaforth)

#### - [Udamonic Scamp (FlashForth)](https://udamonic.com/index.html)
