# Welcome to Peacock Dreams

This is my blog, which I have decided to create to note down and capture random
projects and work I have been doing.

It isn't supposed to be formal or complete.

## What have I been doing recently?

I recently finished my part time online computer science MSc, and am waiting to
hear back and see if I passed! :sweat_smile:
You can see my dissertation project at [https://github.com/rej696/dissertation.git)].

Since finishing my Masters (and a bit during) I have been doing a number of things:
- Learning Perl for scripting :camel:
- Programming a CubeSat based game using Lua and Pico-8 <https://github.com/rej696/
- Learning ARM Cortex-A, CMake and C++ (for work)

## What am I planning to do
I've got lots of ideas for projects (too many):
- Complete miro sameks modern embedded programming course, but with zig on the stm32 blackpill
- Write a forth for some micro
- Play around with the Daisy microcontroller, and learn Digital Signal Processing to write synthesisers
- I just got a RG35XXSP gameboy advance SP emulator thing, and want to get a
  terminal running on that for fun, and run my Pico8 games on it
- I've got a whole bunch of books to read on my todo list:
    - Learning Perl, Intermediate Perl, Programming Perl
    - A Tour of C++
    - Understanding Digital Signal Processing
    - Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
    - Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces
